The team is providing  a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organisations, including whether they ultimately became successful. Using machine learning and neural networks, we'll decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.
